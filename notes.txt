Inventory system:

Hollownest and Pharloom Merchant Database
Pins, Needles, and Tools for sale

Tables:
-Inventory
-Items
-Types

Inventory fields:
-id
-itemId
-quantity

Items fields:
-id
-name
-typeId

Types fields:
-id
-name

The types and items are setup

Current ToDo:
Write a function that
-pulls all the items
-creates an object with each type as a key
-each value is an array of the items that have that type

First I'll need a function that
-pulls all the types
-stores them in an object with the id as key
